  <h2> Description </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Risotto </strong>is a dish made using a short-grain rice, typically arborio, and cooking it in stock over time. Typical ingredients include sausage, onion, garlic, and squash.

    I like to make risotto with chicken stock. Using spicy sausage as well as some minced jalapenos will add some kick! Topping it off with fresh basil adds some needed freshness to the dish.
